# **TrackMe Application**

Hello, my name is Michael.

TrackMe is a web application for tracking bugs in projects.

As the first main part, this will include only the **backend** of the application. The **frontend** implementation is TBD.

The application architecture will be microservices. 

The technology stack:  
    - Spring Framework (Boot, Cloud, ...)  
    - Eureka  
    - Zuul  
    - Hibernate
    - PostgreSQL
    - Docker

_This is the first draft of the Readme file, and it will be updated along the way._
